This project is a proof of concept following a rabbitmq Java tutorial.
    References:
    https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-java.html

All the following should be done on the same host.

1. Run the rabbitmq docker container
    docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name rabbit -p 5671:5671 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3

2. Build the rabbitmq project.
    gradle assemble

3. Run one or more consumers.
    java -jar consumer/build/libs/consumer-1.0.0.jar

    The consumer(s) should now be waiting for messages.

4. Run a producer to queue up one or more tasks.
    java -jar producer/build/libs/producer-1.0.0.jar <message1:sleepTimeSec1> <message2:sleepTimeSec2>

    Eg.
    java -jar producer/build/libs/producer-1.0.0.jar "1st message:5" "2nd message:3" "3rd message:4"

    If you have 2 consumers running simultaneously with the above three messages, the first consumer should consume
    the "1st message" and wait for 5 seconds. The second consumer should consume the "2nd message" and wait for 3
    seconds. Then, the second consumer should get the "3rd message" and wait for 4 seconds.
